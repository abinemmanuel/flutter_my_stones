# my_stones

A basic Flutter project to explore how to create a widget using `MaterialApp`.

* Created a single screen app with a **title** and an **image** in `lib/main.dart`
* Implemented unit test for the app in `test/widget_test.dart`
* Assets can be added within teh project directory (/images/ in this instance) and can be mapped to project using `pubspec.yaml` --> `flutter` --> `assets` --> `asset name `or `directory name/asset name` or `directory name` if all assets inside directory need to be added.
* App is written in **dart** language and is capable of building as a *native app* in both iOS and Android platform.
* Tested and debugged on both **iOS** as well as **Android** simulator.
